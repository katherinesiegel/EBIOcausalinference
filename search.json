    "text": "Programming in R will be a key part of this course, and as most of you have probably experienced, R can cause headaches and stress! Files go missing, package dependencies spiral out of control, and minor code errors can cost us hours of troubleshooting. The point of this course is not to become an R whiz, and we don’t want code errors to get in the way of your learning and research progress.\nWe encourage you to use online resources for coding help if/when you get stuck. StackOverflow is a great resource for finding solutions to coding issues or asking a specific question, as is the RStudio Community. Twitter can also be a great resource: if you post a question with the hashtag #rstats, a kind soul might give you an answer. If you’re looking for help via Google, we recommend including in your query the package you’re using and if applicable, the error message you’re getting. Finally, if you are a visual learner, Allison Horst has some great learning tools for various R functions.\nIf you could use some more training and exposure to R, here are some resources to get started:\n* swirl teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console! On this page, swirl will walk you through each of the steps required to begin using R and swirl today!\n* R for data science (R4DS). R4DS teaches you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualize it and model it. The book is available online, where you can find a practicum of skills for data science from visualization to wrangling and writing functions.\n* Have a favorite resource? Please send it to Laura and Katherine so we can post it!"

    "section": "Course Description",
    "text": "Course Description\nHow does biodiversity effect ecosystem functioning? What are the consequences of temperature variability for parasite loads and host populations? How do plant communities respond to drought, and which ecosystems respond most? Do restoration and conservation work? How does climate change affect disturbance regimes? Cause and effect questions like these motivate much of the empirical work in basic and applied ecological and environmental sciences. Does X cause Y? If X causes Y, does it cause Y in all situations? Through what mechanisms does X cause Y? If X causes Y, how large is the effect of X on Y and how does the size compare to other causes of Y? To answer these cause-and-effect questions, a counterfactual model of causality and a unified methodological framework has been developed yet is not often taught or emphasized in ecology and EBIO more generally. Now this framework is the predominant approach for causal inference in a diversity of fields including public health, economics, and computer science (which is also referred to as program evaluation or impact evaluation).\nGiven the increasing access to spatiotemporally large observational datasets (e.g., remotely sensed data, data from long-term ecological monitoring), we have unprecedented opportunities to answer questions about causal relationships and mechanisms outside of the context of traditional ecological approaches to experimental design. Deriving causal inferences from observational data presents its own set of challenges, and this course presents statistical methods to overcome challenges for causal inference in both observational and experimental study designs.\nThis class aims to teach students to apply and interpret the counterfactual causality model and associated methods in answering empirical questions in basic and applied ecology. As a 3-credit graduate course, this course has a corresponding reading load with an emphasis on readings that elucidate the intuition and the application of the core conceptual ideas. We are firm believers that the most fundamental principles can be stated in plain English and conceptual understanding is just as important as the math. Thus the course stresses intuition (in English) over mechanics and proofs. Nevertheless, students will be expected to apply the mechanics in replication exercises in R statistical software and in a final a project related to the students’ thesis.\nWhether you are a student with substantial graduate work in empirical methods or a student with only the basic pre-requisites covered (some introductory statistics or biostatistics is required), you should expect to gain a deeper understanding of approaches to answering causal questions and of the nature of evidence. Importantly, you will see more clearly the conceptual connections among the various approaches to estimating causal effects – experiments and observational analyses. Even for students with substantial coursework in statistics, these connections are often missed.\nWhile most students who will take this class are in EBIO fields, you should expect to do readings outside of EBIO areas and to see examples from other fields – because ecology and evolutionary biology is lagging behind other fields in several areas we will cover. On the bright side, reading beyond the typical EBIO papers will provide you with an entry point into the broader literature on causal inference, stemming from economics, public health, epidemiology, political science, and other fields. Thus, we see the use of broader readings and examples as intentional to meet the course’s learning objectives, and as a potential competitive advantage – and a way to expand your thinking – rather than a distraction from topics that interest you most. In our experience, gaining perspective on methods and language used in other fields will also provide you with skills to foster collaborations across disciplines. We will also invite guest speakers who are experts to showcase applications of the theory and approaches to questions and data in ecology, conservation, and evolution/behavior – and present some of our in-progress research using causal inference approaches applied to EBIO.\nWe have outlined a provisional syllabus below, but we can adapt it based on student interests and background. The main emphasis of the course is like any other graduate course: to encourage students to think critically, to speak and write simply and clearly, collaborate, to own and use a body of facts and ideas that are widely known, to detect errors and fallacies, to resolve intellectual problems, and to advance our collective knowledge through independent research and applied statistics."

    "text": "Readings\nThe course reading list will include journal articles and book chapters that we will make available to you on our course website. Throughout the semester, the class will compile a running glossary of “jargon” and terms and concepts in causal inference to provide notes as reference. We (the instructors) will provide a bibliography of additional readings and coding resources on various topics for students as reference.\nThe readings differ in their depth and use of math and notation. You do not need to understand all the equations and notation to gain intuition about the material and concepts. Try to learn it but try not to be too stressed by it."

In the latter half of the course, we will shift to workshopping our own projects and discussing additional issues and considerations with applied causal inference. In this way, we will use a partially flipped classroom and strive to create a collaborative and inclusive classroom environment to discuss, ask questions, collaborate, and get feedback on your analyses.\nThe tentative schedule of content, subject to change based on student interests, is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonday\nWednesday\n\n\n\n\nWeek 1 (1/16)\nNo class\nCourse intro\n\n\nWeek 2 (1/23)\nIntro to causal inference and counterfactual causality\nIntro to the main frameworks for counterfactual causal inference\n\n\nWeek 3 (1/30)\nIntro to DAGs\nWorkshopping DAGs\n\n\nWeek 4 (2/6)\nRandomized Controlled Experiments (or RCTs) and experimental design\nDissect experimental design with respect to assumptions required for causal inference\n\n\nWeek 5 (2/13)\nObservational data and counterfactuals\nIntroduction to quasi-experimental methods\n\n\nWeek 6 (2/20)\nPre-regression matching\nPaper discussion and replication exercise\n\n\nWeek 7 (2/27)\nDifference in Difference (DiD)\nPaper discussion\n\n\nWeek 8 (3/6)\nPanel methods\nPaper discussion and replication exercise\n\n\nWeek 9 (3/13)\nRegression Discontinuity Designs (RDD)\nPaper discussion\n\n\nWeek 10 (3/20)\nInstrumental Variables\nPaper discussion\n\n\nWeek 11 (3/27)\nSpring break (no class)\nSpring break (no class)\n\n\nWeek 12 (4/3)\nFurther topics\nChallenges for causal mechanisms OR heterogeneous treatment effects\n\n\nWeek 13 (4/10)\nApplying methods through projects\nPresentations for feedback\n\n\nWeek 14 (4/17)\nProject work and workshopping\nProject work and workshopping OR special topics\n\n\nWeek 15 (4/24)\nProject work and workshopping\nProject work and workshopping OR special topics\n\n\nWeek 16 (5/1)\nProject presentations\nProject presentations"
