title: "Schedule"
---

In general, on Mondays we will have brief lectures and demonstrations in R, while on Wednesdays, we will have student-led paper discussions and/or replication exercises of published papers. In the latter half of the course, we will shift to workshopping our own projects and discussing additional issues and considerations with applied causal inference. In this way, we will use a partially flipped classroom and strive to create a collaborative and inclusive classroom environment to discuss, ask questions, collaborate, and get feedback on your analyses. 

The tentative schedule of content, subject to change based on student interests, is as follows: 

|     |                Monday              |          Wednesday                     |
