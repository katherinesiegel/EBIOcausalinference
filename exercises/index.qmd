## Monday 2/20
[Matching demo in R](https://github.com/katherinesiegel/EBIOcausalinference/blob/main/exercises/matching_demo.Rmd). I couldn't figure out a cute way for you to be able to download this directly as a RMarkdown file (thwarted by quarto...). But this link will take you to the page in the course's GitHub repository where the RMarkdown file is stored. Click on "Raw," then you can copy and paste the code into an RMarkdown on your computer.
