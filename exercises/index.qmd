This section has link to the files for the demos and replication exercises that we will do in class. Here, you will find link to files with annotated code and csv files with data for the replication exercises.

## Monday 2/20
[Matching demo in R](https://github.com/katherinesiegel/EBIOcausalinference/blob/main/exercises/matching_demo.Rmd). I couldn't figure out a cute way for you to be able to download this directly as a RMarkdown file (thwarted by quarto...). But this link will take you to the page in the course's GitHub repository where the RMarkdown file is stored. Click on "Raw," then you can copy and paste the code into an RMarkdown on your computer.

## Monday 2/27
[Diff-in-Diff regression demo in R](https://github.com/katherinesiegel/EBIOcausalinference/tree/main/exercises/DiD_demo)
Application and interpretation of differences-in-differences to examine effects of the Marshall Fire on vegetation in Boulder, CO. Data file is on Canvas course page. 

## Monday 3/6
[Panel regression demo in R](https://github.com/katherinesiegel/EBIOcausalinference/blob/main/exercises/Panel_demo/Rmarkdown_panel_designs_Dee_and_Severen.html)
This tutorial replicates the main analyses in Dee et al, contrasted with common approaches in ecology (mixed effect models and conditioning on observable covariates. For the rest of the supplemental analyses in Dee et al, see [L.Dee's GitHub](https://github.com/LauraDee/NutNetCausalinf)
