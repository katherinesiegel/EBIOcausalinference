Adapted from the supplementary materials from Butsic, V. et al. (2017): Quasi-experimental methods enable stronger inferences from observational data in ecology. (c) Matthias Baumann (2017-01-10).\t\n\n### Scenario\nIn the Sims 2010 paper, she is interested in the effect of forest protection on socioeconomic outcomes. Here, we will use a toy dataset to explore a scenario where we need to use instrumental variables rather than OLS. \n\nFor the purposes of this exercise, we will simplify Sims's dataset. Let's say we are interested in the effect of the presence of protected forests in a locality (treatment) on average monthly household consumption (outcome). We have sampled average monthly household consumption at a set of localities, where we have also recorded data on average slope and elevation and the distance to major cities. Due to the nonrandom placement of protected areas, we suspect that there are unobserved variables that influence the placement of protected areas and socioeconomic outcomes -- we have an issue of endogeneity. In this example, the unobserved variable is the historical presence of strong local institutions.\n\nIn our simulated data, we know the true relationships between the variables, which helps us see the different results we get from analyzing the effect of forest protection on the socioeconomic outcome using OLS vs. instrumental variables. In this example, we know that there is no correlation between the presence of protected forests and unobservable covariates of average monthly household consumption.\n\nWe need an instrumental variable that is correlated with the presence of protected forests (the treatment) but that is not correlated with average monthly household consumption (the outcome) except through its relationship with the presence of protected forests. Here, whether or not the locality intersects a major tributary could be an appropriate instrument, as a proxy for priority watershed status: priority watershed status is related to the conservation objective of watershed protection, and thus is related to the placement of protected areas, but there is no other mechanism through which the distance to the nearest major tributary affects average monthly household consumption. Distance to the nearest major tributary is not correlated with the unobserved historical presence of strong local institutions.\n\n## Set up\nLoad required packages. In this demo, we will use the package \"AER\".\n\n\n\n\n## Simulate data\nSimulated data is handy because we know the true effect of the treatment variable\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Write function to simulate a dataset\nsimulate_data <- function(){\n  \n  ## Create data variables within data.frame\n  \n  ## Make a column for observation ID\n  df <- data.frame(id = seq(1, 1000),\n                   \n                   ## Columns for explanatory variables\n                   \n                   ## Treatment variable\n                   forest_protect = c(rep(0,500), rep(1,500)),\n                   \n                   ## Other covariates\n                   slope = runif(1000, min = 50, max = 100),\n                   elevation = runif(1000, min = 150, max = 185),\n                   dist_cities = runif(1000, min = 0, max = 250),\n                   \n                   ## Unobserved variable\n                   local_inst = c(rep(0,100), rep(1,500), rep(0,400)),\n                   \n                   ## A column for the error term\n                   error = rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 5),\n                   \n                   ### And the instrumental variable\n                   tributary = c(rep(0,500), rep(1,200), rep(0,300)))\n  \n## Make a column for the outcome variable (average monthly household consumption)  \n  df$consumpt <- 1 + 5*df$forest_protect + 0.07*df$slope + \n    0.05*df$elevation + 2*df$dist_cities + 5*df$local_inst + df$error\n  return(df)  \n}\n```\n:::\n\n\n*We know that the true effect of the endogenous explanatory variable (the presence of protected forests in the locality) is a 5x increase in the response variable (the average monthly household consumption in that locality).*\n\n\n## Estimate the effect using ordinary least squares  \nIn each of the methods we use to estimate the effect of forest protection on socioeconomic outcomes, we will simulate the dataset 1000 times and calculate the average treatment effect across the 1000 simulations. Otherwise, we might estimate a treatment effect that differs from the true treatment effect due to random chance in a given simulated dataset.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n### Write a function to generate data and analyze using OLS \nols_fun = function(){\n  \n  ## Simulate the dataset\n  data <- simulate_data()\n  \n  ## Run OLS\n  ols <- lm(consumpt ~ forest_protect + slope + elevation + \n              dist_cities, data = data)\n  \n  ## Extract model coefficients and standard error\n  protect_coeff <- coef(summary(ols))[\"forest_protect\", \"Estimate\"]\n  protect_se <- coef(summary(ols))[\"forest_protect\", \"Std.
